- User claims to be using T-pose, but error persists
- Need to investigate T-pose validation requirements
- Research auto-generation fitting point mechanics

### 2. EveryWear Rigging Transfer Failure
**Reported Issue**: "failed to transfer the avatar's rigging information to the garment"
- Critical for MD2025 workflow (relates to Task 38)
- Affects VRChat optimization capabilities
- May impact Very Poor escape strategies (Task 37)

### 3. Unity Modular Avatar Setup Issue
**Reported Issue**: "outfit doesn't follow rig due to missing rigging"
- Integration problem between MD and Unity
- Affects final VRChat implementation
- Rigging transfer chain breakdown

## Investigation Strategy

- Deep dive into each error condition
- Map error triggers and conditions
- Document software version dependencies
- Test reproduction scenarios

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration Analysis
**Target Enhancement**: `docs/workflows/avatar-import.md`
- Analyze T-pose requirements and validation
- Document EveryWear integration points
- Map rigging transfer dependencies
- Identify workflow failure points

### Phase 3: Solution Development
**Target Creation**: `docs/workflows/technical-troubleshooting.md`
- Develop systematic diagnostic procedures
- Create step-by-step recovery methods
- Document preventive measures
- Provide verification checkpoints

### Phase 4: Documentation Integration
- Update existing troubleshooting sections
- Add new error categories and solutions
- Enhance avatar import guidelines
- Create cross-references between related issues

## Research Requirements

### Technical Investigation Areas
1. **T-Pose Validation**: What constitutes proper T-pose in MD context?
2. **Avatar Geometry Requirements**: Mesh quality needed for auto-generation
3. **EveryWear Prerequisites**: Exact requirements for successful rigging transfer
4. **Unity Integration Points**: Where rigging transfer can fail
5. **Version Compatibility**: Software version interactions affecting these issues

### Documentation Analysis Needs
1. **Gap Identification**: What's missing from current troubleshooting?
2. **User Journey Mapping**: Where these errors typically occur in workflow
3. **Solution Effectiveness**: Which solutions work for which scenarios
4. **Prevention Strategies**: How to avoid these issues proactively

## Target Audience Impact

### Primary Beneficiaries
- **Beginners** experiencing technical barriers early in learning
- **Intermediate users** transitioning to MD2025/EveryWear workflows
- **Advanced users** seeking systematic troubleshooting approaches

- Add rigging validation checkpoints
- Include EveryWear preparation steps

### 4. Unity Integration Troubleshooting
- Modular Avatar setup verification
- Rigging transfer validation procedures
- Common integration failure solutions

## Success Criteria

1. **Issue Resolution**: Clear solutions for all three reported problems
2. **Prevention Focus**: Proactive measures to avoid these issues
3. **Systematic Approach**: Diagnostic procedures that lead to solutions
4. **Documentation Quality**: Enhanced troubleshooting capability across all guides
5. **User Empowerment**: Users can self-diagnose and resolve technical issues

## Strategic Importance

This investigation directly addresses the gap between basic troubleshooting and complex technical issues that experienced users encounter. By solving these problems:

1. **Removes Technical Barriers**: Users can progress past complex issues
2. **Improves Success Rates**: Higher completion rates for garment creation
3. **Enhances Documentation Quality**: More comprehensive troubleshooting
4. **Supports Advanced Workflows**: Enables MD2025/EveryWear adoption

## Next Steps

**Article-orchestrator should**:
1. Analyze each technical issue in depth
2. Research MD documentation and community resources
3. Develop systematic investigation approach
4. Create comprehensive solutions and documentation enhancements
5. Ensure integration with existing Tasks 37 and 38

**Expected Impact**: Transform technical barriers into learning opportunities, significantly improving success rates for Japanese VRChat garment creators encountering advanced technical issues.
