# URGENT TASK ASSIGNMENT - Task 37: Very Poor脱却完全ガイド

## Task Priority: CRITICAL - Community Social Impact Issue

Based on comprehensive Japanese VRChat community research (2024-2025), this is now the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** task due to serious social impact. Users are experiencing exclusion from VRChat events due to "Very Poorお断り" policies, creating barriers to community participation.

## Task Details

**Target Files to Create:**
- `docs/optimization/very-poor-escape.md` (primary comprehensive guide)
- `docs/optimization/performance-analysis.md` (analysis tools and metrics)
- `docs/optimization/mobile-compatibility.md` (Quest/mobile optimization focus)

## Critical Community Problems to Solve

1. **Social Exclusion**: Users excluded from VRChat events due to Very Poor performance rating
2. **Mobile Invisibility**: Mobile users unable to see Very Poor avatars
3. **Knowledge Gap**: Lack of specific numerical targets and verification methods
4. **Tool Confusion**: Uncertainty about Avatar Optimizer, Mantis LOD, lilNDMF, PhysBone optimization

## Required Implementation Content

### Core Technical Content
- **Concrete numerical targets** for escaping Very Poor rating with specific metrics
- **Step-by-step Avatar Optimizer (AAO)** complete configuration guide
- **PhysBone optimization** techniques specifically for mobile compatibility
- **Texture compression** and resolution optimization workflows
- **Mantis LOD Editor** detailed workflow (proven 63% polygon reduction effectiveness)
- **lilNDMFMeshSimplifier** integration guide (updated 2024/10/19 version)
- **Performance verification** methods and testing procedures
- **Troubleshooting section** for common optimization failures and solutions

### Community Research Findings Integration
- Address "Very Poorでも軽量アバター" high-demand searches
- Solve event exclusion motivation loss with encouraging success stories
- Bridge technical knowledge gaps with step-by-step guidance
- Provide immediately actionable, practical solutions

## Target Audience

**Complete beginners** currently experiencing social exclusion due to Very Poor ratings, requiring:
- Encouraging, supportive tone while solving serious technical problems
- Clear recovery paths from optimization failures
- Immediate actionable steps with measurable results
- Success verification methods

## Strategic Importance

This task directly addresses the **most serious community pain point** identified in our 2024-2025 research. Successful completion will have **immediate positive social impact** for Japanese VRChat creators, removing barriers to community participation and creative expression.

## Success Criteria

1. Users can follow the guide and successfully escape Very Poor rating
2. Clear, measurable metrics provided for verification
3. Mobile compatibility specifically addressed
4. Tool integration confusion resolved
5. Community social barriers reduced through technical solutions

**Next Step**: Article-orchestrator should analyze scope, create delegation plan, and begin implementation of this critical community support content.
